# 1. Install OpenCV with debug libs on your system.
# 2. Take two photos of a static (not changing) object,
# about 3m away from two view points, with about
# 10cm horizontal distance.
# 3. Measure the overall brightness of the two images and adjust
#  it to the mean value of the two images.
# 4. Create a mixed image and put the red channel from the
#  (adjusted) left image and the green and blue channel from
#  the right image into said mixed image.
#  Do this by (i) looping over all the pixels,
# (ii) by using opencv functions â€“ compare the runtime!
# 5. View the mixed image with red-cyan glasses ;-)
